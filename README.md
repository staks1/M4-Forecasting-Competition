# Convolutional Models for M4 time series forecasting

This project is based on the M4 Time Series Forecasting Competition 'btrotta' entry. In particular I trained and run her convolutional neural networks using her instructions in her repo [btrotta entry] (https://github.com/btrotta/m4).

# Improving the Models
Next I experimented with the architecture of the convolutional models created and their parameters and i tried to improve the models for each frequency . Some functions used are taken from the original [btrotta entry] (https://github.com/btrotta/m4) and others were added. In parrticular besided the new models, functions to observe the training loss and visualize the final predictions are implemented, whereas the final predictions are located in the 'predictions' directory and are split according to frequency.
